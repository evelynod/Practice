# Fizzy Wizard 
# A challenge from Boots on July 29, 2025
# Write a class called "Wizard" with an attribute called mana (start it at 50)
# Then, if you create a wizard and call cast_spell, the mana will decrease as intended!  

# A challenge from Boots: Add a regenerate mana method that increases Fizzy's mana by a certain
# amount.
# Now allow that regenerate mana amount to be changed.
